Ight boys, Do the tutorial on how to use the github desktop
once you have that kinda down, youre good to go. Imma add some stuff on github where it checks continuity of code to make sure no errors occur from different pulls, or that they merge them properly 

If you have anything to ask, just send in gc, Theres also a project manager board with tasks and timeline stuff, add stuff that you think needs to be addressed, make sure to do basic task that build up, not like something big like object detection. spilt it ip into tiny cuts. thank you chobbers


Also make sure to push any Progress or pull any progress from day to day, stuff is always changing unless youre working on a certain problem by yourself

If two people are working in different directions on the same problem (using different ways/ideas to solve it), Make sure to create your own side branch and then we'll pick and choose what to push to main, but preferably work on it together instead aka dont waste time.
